# Bluetooth System Application

Reverse engineer an application which is used in a car to connect your mobile phone's / Bluetooth enabled device to play audio files / dial or receive calls etc. At a max the application can store information of 5 devices. If you want to include a new device you need to delete one of the devices and insert the new one. If a condition arises, say in the same instance all the 5 phones are trying to connect, which phone will be connected. Implement the above scenario using various test cases.
